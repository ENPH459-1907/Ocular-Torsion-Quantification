    '''
    Performs a pseduo 2D cross correlation method to calculate the relative shift
    between features in the given iris segment and a reference window. A moving
    window is taken from the current iris segment and the 2D correlation coefficient
    is calculated between the two matrices. Relative to other image convolution
    methods, in this function the window only moves along one axis (columns) but the
    correlation coefficient is calculated in two dimensions.

    There are two different methods of performing the cross correlation: 'full' or
    'subset'. In both methods, the maximum torsion is limited to +- 25 degrees to
    decrease the total number of comparisions required. The 'subset' method involves
    less comparisions but is less robust then the 'full' method as less points are
    used to calculate the correlation coefficient.

    'subset' - A smaller subset of the original segment is considered as the reference
        window. A window of the same size is taken from the current iris segement
        and the correlation coefficient is then computed.'

    'full' - The reference window is extended by the maximum torsion angle (25 deg)
        and the full iris segment is used as the moving window. The size of the
        moving window is equal to the size of the iris segment.

    There are two modes for quantifying the torsion: 'interp' and 'upsample'.

    'interp' - Interpolates the cross correlation coefficient values.
        See 'corr_interp' for more details.

    'upsample' - Used when passing an iris segment that has been upsampled.
        To accurately calculate the torsion, the resulotion must be equal to the
        upsampled resolution or the iris segment.

    See 'corr_upsample'
        for more details.

    Parameters
    ------------------------
    iris_seg : 2D array_like NxM
        Unwrapped iris segment, in polar coordinates.

    reference_window : 2D array_like NxK
        Intial window used as the reference for all rotation.

        Depending on the size of the reference window relative to the iris_seg,
        a different torsion_mode will be used to perform the cross correlation.

        'subset' - If K < M then a window of size NxK is taken from the iris
            segment and compared against the reference window. In total there
            is M - K possible windows available from the iris segment.

        'full' - If K >= M then the window will be the iris segement and the
            size of the window will be unmodified. The size of reference
            window should be K = M + 2 * max angle of torsion. The iris segement is
            then shifted 2 * max angle across the the reference window in order to
            perform the cross correlation.

    start : int, default = 0
        Starting index location of the window. Leave start as 0 for 'full' method.

    prev_deg : float
        Previous rotation angle. If an error occurs, the method will default
        to prev_deg.

    torsion_mode : optional, str {'interp', 'upsample'}
        Select the operation torsion_mode. 'interp' will interpolate the Correlation
        result. 'upsample' assumes the input iris_seg has been upsampled by a
        specific resolution.

    resolution : float, 0 < x < 1, default = 1
        'interp' - The resolution will define dx for the interpolated function.
        'upsample' - The resolution corresponds to the upsampled resolution.

    threshold : float, 0 =< x < 1, default = 0
        Minimum correlation value of correlation, all correlation values less
        then threshold will be ignored.

    max_angle : float 0 =< x < 360, default = 25
        The maximum angle of rotation of the eye. Only values within + and -
        max_angle will be considered.

    Returns
    ------------------------
    deg : float (in degrees)
        The amount of rotation of the iris relative to the reference window.
